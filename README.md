# QualOpt

This is the front end code for the QualOpt project. This includes html, css and javascript for the user interface for researchers.
Currently the code is configured to use localhost at port 8080 as its server.
An important thing to note is that testing should be done with web security disabled due to a cross origin error when trying to send Ajax calls to localhost server. This can be done on chrome by using this in the command prompt: "C:\Program Files (x86)\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe" --disable-web-security --user-data-dir="D:\chrome"
